# print('''Twinkle, twinkle, little star
# How I wonder what you are
# Up above the world so high
# Like a diamond in the sky

# When the blazing sun is gone
# When he nothing shines upon
# Then you show your little light
# Twinkle, twinkle, all the night

# Then the traveller in the dark
# Thanks you for your tiny spark
# He could not see which way to go
# If you did not twinkle so

# In the dark blue sky you keep
# And often through my curtains peep
# For you never shut your eye
# 'Til the sun is in the sky

# And as you bright and tiny spark
# Lights the traveler in the dark
# Though I know not what you are
# Twinkle, twinkle little star

# Twinkle, twinkle little star
# How I wonder what you are
# Up above the world so high
# Like a diamond in the sky
# Twinkle, twinkle little star
# How I wonder what you are

# How I wonder what you are''')
