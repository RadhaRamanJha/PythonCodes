print('''Twinkle, twinkle, little star
 How I wonder what you are
 Up above the world so high
 Like a diamond in the sky
 When the blazing sun is gone
 When he nothing shines upon
 Then you show your little light
 Twinkle, twinkle, all the night
 Then the traveller in the dark
 Thanks you for your tiny spark
 He could not see which way to go
 If you did not twinkle so
 In the dark blue sky you keep
 And often through my curtains peep
 For you never shut your eye
 'Til the sun is in the sky
 And as you bright and tiny spark
 Lights the traveler in the dark
 Though I know not what you are
 Twinkle, twinkle little star
 Twinkle, twinkle little star
 How I wonder what you are
 Up above the world so high
 Like a diamond in the sky
 Twinkle, twinkle little star
 How I wonder what you are
 How I wonder what you are\n''')
