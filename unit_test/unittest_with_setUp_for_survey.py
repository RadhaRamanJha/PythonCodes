""" When a test case is running, Python prints one character for each unit test as it is
completed. A passing test prints a dot, a test that results in an error prints an E, and
a test that results in a failed assertion prints an F. This is why youâ€™ll see a different
number of dots and characters on the first line of output when you run your test cases.
If a test case takes a long time to run because it contains many unit tests, you can
watch these results to get a sense of how many tests are passing."""
